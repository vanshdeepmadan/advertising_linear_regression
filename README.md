**Optimizing Advertising Spend with Linear Regression**  
**Objective:** Built and evaluated a multiple linear regression model to analyze the impact of advertising spend across **TV, Radio, and Newspaper** on product sales, using real-world data.

**Key Contributions:**
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis** to identify strong linear relationships between advertising channels and sales.
- Built and compared multiple models:
  - Achieved **R² = 0.90** using only **TV and Radio**, outperforming models using individual channels or adding Newspaper.
  - Demonstrated that **Radio provides the highest return per dollar**, supported by model coefficients and R² impact analysis.
- Performed **residual diagnostics** to validate model assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, normality of residuals).
- Used **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** to confirm low multicollinearity and model stability.
- Applied **optimization techniques** to recommend optimal budget allocation strategies under business constraints.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy
